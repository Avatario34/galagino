# Cabinet

The cabinet consists of 15 lasercut 3mm plywood parts.

The cabinet consits of two main side sections and 13 parts to be
mounted between both sides. The electronics are either secured between
two wooden parts (display between parts 1, 5 and 10) and ESP32 between
parts 11 and 13) or screwed a wooden part (speaker to part 12 and coin
button to part 6). The LED stripe comes with adhesive tape and sticks
to its wooden part 9.

The [transparent plasic part for the marquee](../marquee) as well as
the [control board](../controlboard) and the [coin
button](../coinbutton) are 3d printed and are either screwed to the
plywood parts 6 and 12 or use the same 3mm flanges and are inserted
into the side parts just like the other wooden parts are.

If no illuminated marquee is wanted, then the plywood part 2 is used
instead of the 3D printed transparent part and the LED stripe is not
attached to part 9.

The following files can be used with most laser cutters. All
parts fit onto one single A4 sized piece of 3mm thick plywood.

Once the electronics are [assembled and tested](../assembly)
the are mounted to their plywood parts.

The LEDs are attached to their plywood part 9 and stuck into the
top part 3. Once the top part is secured to one side using a M2*8mm
screw part 9 attaches quite firmly to the top part 3. The
cable needs to go above the display and part 10.

All parts are assembled onto on of the two identical side parts.
Then the second side is mounted. It's easiest to leave the rear
part 12 open while attaching the second side, so the other parts
inside can be reached from the rear and moved to their exact
positions.

Once both sides are fully attached the rear part 12 can carefully be
inserted to finish the setup. During assembly the sides may be secured
using e.g. masking tape. Once done four M2 * 8mm screws and four M2
nuts are used to secure the sides to parts 3 and 8. Be careful
not to drop the nuts into the assembled device. A piece of tape
placed in the inside of parts 3 and 8 may help keeping the nuts from
being lost during assembly.

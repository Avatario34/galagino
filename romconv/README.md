# romconv - ROM/bin file conversion

Arcade emulation involves dealing with the original ROM files of the
machines in question. Sometimes the conversion is little more than the
transcription from binary to a equivalent C source file.  But in many
cases this conversion includes data processing. E.g.  all color tables
are converted into the 16 bit color format used by the ILI9341 or
ST7789 displays. Sprite and tile data is converted into a format
easier to process on the ESP32. The logo conversion for the menu 
might require the seperate installation of the ```imageio python module``` which
can e.g. be done by the following command:

```pip3 install imageio```

This could all be done on the ESP32 target at run time. But here it's
done beforehand. This offloads these tasks from the EPS32.

It's possible to implement only one or two of the three arcade
machines. In that case the related ROM conversion can be omitted and
the machine in question has to be disabled in the file
[config.h](../galagino/config.h).

The necessary ROM files need be placed in the [roms directory](../roms)
before these scripts can be run. Once these are converted you need
also also [convert the audio samples](../samples).

## Generic ROM conversion

The tilemap as well as the patched Z80 emulation is need by all three 
arcade machine. This has thus always to be converted.

```
./tileaddr.py ../galagino/tileaddr.h
./z80patch.py
```

## Pac-Man ROM conversion

Pac-Man comes with code ROMs as well as ROMs containing graphic data, color tables
and audio waveforms. These can be converted using the following commands:

```
./audioconv.py pacman_wavetable ../roms/82s126.1m ../roms/82s126.3m ../galagino/pacman_wavetable.h
./cmapconv.py pacman_colormap ../roms/82s123.7f 0 ../roms/82s126.4a ../galagino/pacman_cmap.h
./logoconv.py ../logos/pacman.png ../galagino/pacman_logo.h
./romconv.py pacman_rom ../roms/pacman.6e ../roms/pacman.6f ../roms/pacman.6h ../roms/pacman.6j ../galagino/pacman_rom.h
./spriteconv.py pacman_sprites pacman ../roms/pacman.5f ../galagino/pacman_spritemap.h
./tileconv.py ../roms/pacman.5e ../galagino/pacman_tilemap.h
```

## Galaga ROM conversion

Galaga is technically very similar to Pac-Man and needs very similar files. In this case three code ROMs need
to be converted as the Galaga arcade was driven by three Z80 CPUs.

The Galaga ROM #1 will be patches when given the ```-p``` option. This will
disable the RAM and ROM tests of the Galaga arcade machine and speeds up the loading of that machine:

```
./romconv.py -p galaga_rom_cpu1 ../roms/gg1_1b.3p ../roms/gg1_2b.3m ../roms/gg1_3.2m ../roms/gg1_4b.2l ../galagino/galaga_rom1.h
```

For the full retro-experience simply omit the option and the resulting Galagino setup will include all the self tests of the original machine:

```
./romconv.py galaga_rom_cpu1 ../roms/gg1_1b.3p ../roms/gg1_2b.3m ../roms/gg1_3.2m ../roms/gg1_4b.2l ../galagino/galaga_rom1.h
```

The remaining files are just converted without patching.

```
./audioconv.py galaga_wavetable ../roms/prom-1.1d ../galagino/galaga_wavetable.h
./cmapconv.py galaga_colormap_sprites ../roms/prom-5.5n 0 ../roms/prom-3.1c ../galagino/galaga_cmap_sprites.h
./cmapconv.py galaga_colormap_tiles ../roms/prom-5.5n 16 ../roms/prom-4.2n ../galagino/galaga_cmap_tiles.h
./logoconv.py ../logos/galaga.png ../galagino/galaga_logo.h
./romconv.py galaga_rom_cpu2 ../roms/gg1_5b.3f ../galagino/galaga_rom2.h
./romconv.py galaga_rom_cpu3 ../roms/gg1_7b.2c ../galagino/galaga_rom3.h
./spriteconv.py galaga_sprites galaga ../roms/gg1_11.4d ../roms/gg1_10.4f ../galagino/galaga_spritemap.h
./starsets.py ../galagino/galaga_starseed.h
./tileconv.py ../roms/gg1_9.4l ../galagino/galaga_tilemap.h
```

Additional the sample for the Galaga explosion sound needs to be converted as described in the 
[samples](../samples) directory.

## Donkey Kong ROM conversion

Donkey Kong differs slightly from Pac-Man and Galaga but it's again code ROMs, graphics and colormaps that 
need to be converted. 

```
./cmapconv.py dkong_colormap ../roms/c-2k.bpr ../roms/c-2j.bpr 0 ../roms/v-5e.bpr ../galagino/dkong_cmap.h
./logoconv.py ../logos/dkong.png ../galagino/dkong_logo.h
./romconv.py dkong_rom ../roms/c_5et_g.bin ../roms/c_5ct_g.bin ../roms/c_5bt_g.bin ../roms/c_5at_g.bin ../galagino/dkong_rom.h
./spriteconv.py dkong_sprites dkong ../roms/l_4m_b.bin  ../roms/l_4n_b.bin  ../roms/l_4r_b.bin  ../roms/l_4s_b.bin ../galagino/dkong_spritemap.h  
./tileconv.py ../roms/v_5h_b.bin ../roms/v_3pt.bin ../galagino/dkong_tilemap.h
```

Sound was done in two different waya in Donkey Kong. Some sound was generated by the 8048 CPU which is _not_ emulated in
Galaga. Instead digital sound samples are used to implement all Donkey Kong sounds. These need to be converted as described in the 
[samples](../samples) directory.
